This will explain how to build asus-tcci on your own and/or integrate it into your
custom AsusWRT firmware(s). If you aren't a developer or want to use a pre-compiled
binary, check the README.md file instead.

Building
---

1. Get the source-code of your device firmware (AsusWRT) from the official support page.
2. Extract it somewhere. $HOME/Desktop is fine. ;)
3. Check the provided instructions (the first README you find).
    In particular, check if you should build from src-ra, src-rt, or something else.
    For reference, we'll refer to this (sub)folder as <ASUSWRT-SRC> from now on.
4. Copy the 'asus-tcci' directory (the one that holds this readme) into the
   <ASUSWRT-SRC>/router/ sub-directory.
5. According to the instructions mentioned in point 3, open a terminal and setup your
   PATH, so that you can access the toolchain from the command-line.
6. cd to <ASUSWRT-SRC>/router/asus-tcci and run `./configure`.
7. If it complains about the kernel version, launch `./configure -k <VER>`, replacing
   <VER> with one of the versions displayed on screen (do NOT include the "linux-"
   prefix, just the version number).
8. Once it's configured (no messages on the console), simply launch `make`.

When you build your firmware from these sources, asus-tcci should be integrated as well.
